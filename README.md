# personal

Contains the following projects that aim to help the family out:

A program that, after inputting a list of names, pairs people to give everyone a secret santa who will buy a present for them. When a secret santa types in their name to the command line, the person they are buying a present for appears.

A program that reminds people to do their chore approximately 5 minutes before it needs completing. The reminder is sent via a text message and it uses a CSV file which contains the timetable of chores (ie who is doing what chore at what time of day).
